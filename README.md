# TradingSystem

The TradingSystem is an advanced software project developed as part of my Advanced Software Technology course. The original architecture and design in the linked cocome.pdf were outdated and not very efficient, so I completely redesigned the system to follow Clean Architecture principles. This new approach improves modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

The use cases, however, remain the same as those in the cocome.pdf, which outlines the functional requirements of the system.
